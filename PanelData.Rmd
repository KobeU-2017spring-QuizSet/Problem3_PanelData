In this quize, we will conduct panel data analysis by using `plm` package and its data set.


# Excersise

- install library `plm`
- Use the built in data set on `plm` package, `Gasoline`
- conduct Panel a apnel data analysis (pooling and within)

Here is the regression formula.

```{r}
form <- lgaspcar ~ lincomep + lrpmg + lcarpcap
```


# Sample Answer

If you do not have `plm` package, you need to install it.

```{r}
library(plm)
data("Gasoline", package = "plm")
form <- lgaspcar ~ lincomep + lrpmg + lcarpcap
gasw <-  plm(form, data = Gasoline, model = "within")
gasp <-  plm(form, data = Gasoline, model = "pooling")
summary(gasw)
summary(gasp)
```
